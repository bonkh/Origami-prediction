# Origami Style Classification

## Project Overview
I tried to build a deep learning model to classify origami styles and determine which origamist's folding techniques are most similar to my folding style.

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Background removal and preprocessing using U-Net.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A ResNet-based classification model with transfer learning.
- **Dataset Collection**: Scraped origami model images from various websites.
- **Interface**: Deployed as a simple web application using Streamlit.
